# 🎨 MoMA Art Collection Analysis with Polars 📊  

## Overview  
This project is an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of the **Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) collection**, inspired by Anas Riad's YouTube video. Instead of using **Pandas**, I leveraged **Polars**, a fast and efficient DataFrame library, to explore and analyze the dataset. The analysis focuses on **artist demographics, artwork classifications, and acquisition trends**, providing interactive insights using **Plotly**.  

## 🔍 Key Features  
✅ **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and merged multiple datasets for a comprehensive view  
✅ **EDA with Polars:** Used Polars for fast and efficient data manipulation  
✅ **Visualizations with Plotly:** Created interactive charts for better insights  
✅ **Insights:** Explored gender distribution, nationality trends, and acquisition history
